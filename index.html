      <p> Hi! Welcome to the wonderful world of Greek philosophy. This website is all about love.<br> What are the types of love according to the ancient Greek?<br>
      Where do we see those ideas in our modern world? <br>How can we connect them to the ways in which we love today?</p>

      <p>Eros, named after the Greek god of fertility, is about sexual passion. The Greek gods saw this form of love as fiery, dangerous and irrational. It involves an all-consuming lust and a lack of control
        that frightened the Greek. <br></p>
        <p> Yet today, we see a more interesting approach to Eros. People fiend for a type of love that reliquishes control, something passionate and intense.A lot of us hope to fall madly in love, but is that real?
           Is it sustainable? Longlasting? Mostly, these are romantic relationships that are shorterm, especially if you're young. Is that such a bad thing, however? Isn't it nice to think that you can have genuine passion and heat in a relationship
           at least once in your life, even if it doesn't last forever?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

          <p>Long-Standing Love<br>"about us, whose loving has become so natural that it has rid itself of teeth and claws,<br> implements for the lovers new at love, whose jitters goad them into drawing blood"<br>-Lisel Mueller<br><br></p>
          <p>Pragma is best described as a mature and realistic love. This one is a bit of a modern update of ancient Greek terms, since it was popularized in the 1970s and never explicitely used by ancient Greeks. It's meant<br> to summarize
            Greek standards of love that stands the test of time. A wholesome love that takes compromise, patience and tolerance.<br></p>
            <p>If eros is about falling madly in love, then pragma is about standing in love. In this day and age, I think, mostly for young people, we want to be consumed by romantic love, but fail to understand that it's
              something that takes effort. Maintaing relationships isn't something that many of us think about, which is okay. You don't need to have long-lasting love if you don't want to. But if you do, you need to be prepared to handle the issues
              that come with it with maturity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
