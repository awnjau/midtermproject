      <p> Hi! Welcome to the wonderful world of Greek philosophy. This website is all about love.<br> What are the types of love according to the ancient Greek?<br>
      Where do we see those ideas in our modern world? <br>How can we connect them to the ways in which we love today?</p>

      <p>Eros, named after the Greek god of fertility, is about sexual passion. The Greek gods saw this form of love as fiery, dangerous and irrational. It involves an all-consuming lust and a lack of control

           Is it sustainable? Longlasting? Mostly, these are romantic relationships that are shorterm, especially if you're young. Is that such a bad thing, however? Isn't it nice to think that you can have genuine passion and heat in a relationship

            <p>If eros is about falling madly in love, then pragma is about standing in love. In this day and age, I think, mostly for young people, we want to be consumed by romantic love, but fail to understand that it's
              something that takes effort. Maintaing relationships isn't something that many of us think about, which is okay. You don't need to have long-lasting love if you don't want to. But if you do, you need to be prepared to handle the issues
